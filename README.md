# Geometry

This repository contains 3D printable geometry files. These models are used in our book, [Make:Geometry](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Geometry-coding-printing-building/dp/1680456717). They are explained in associated lesson plans and a Teacher’s Guide, linked at https://www.nonscriptum.com/geometry. A user’s forum is hosted at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/3dp_edu_models.

## Using This Repository

The models in this repository have been developed in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). They are parametric, and you can modify them by opening them in OpenSCAD and modifying the variables at the top of the file. For most models, it is not necessary to understand OpenSCAD syntax, though some of the OpenSCAD files contain several sets of parameters that can be un-commented to produce different examples. For more about how to Use OpenSCAD, check out its [User Manual](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual) and [Syntax Cheat Sheet](https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html).
